## Decomposing between 2 groups
.footnote[Arriaga (1984)]
- E.g., between 2 time periods (2014 and 2017), the general formula is:
$$_{n}\Delta_{x}=\left[\underbrace{l_{x}^{2017}/l_{0}^{2017}}_{\textrm{fraction of survivors}}\times\overbrace{\left(\dfrac{_{n}L_{x}^{2014}}{l_{x}^{2014}}-\dfrac{_{n}L_{x}^{2017}}{l_{x}^{2017}}\right)}^{\textrm{direct effect}}\right]+\overbrace{\left[\dfrac{T_{x+n}^{2014}}{l_{x+n}^{2014}}\times\dfrac{\dfrac{l_{x}^{2017}l_{x+n}^{2014}}{l_{x}^{2014}}-l_{x+n}^{2017}}{l_{0}^{2017}}\right]}^{\textrm{indirect effect + interaction}}$$

- Direct effect multiplies the fraction of survivors at each age by the difference between the 2 groups in 'temporary life expectancy' at a given age.
- Indirect effect happens because differences in the direct effect means more survivors at subsequent ages.

## Decomposing life expectancy differences by cause
The contribution $_{n}\Delta_{x}^{i}$ of each cause of death $i$
within a given age group is a function of the difference between the
two time periods in the proportion of deaths due to a given cause: 

$$_{n}\Delta_{x}^{i}={}_{n}\Delta_{x}\times\dfrac{\overbrace{\left(_{n}p_{x}^{i,2014}\times{}_{n}r_{x}^{2014}\right)-\left(_{n}p_{x}^{i,2017}\times{}_{n}r_{x}^{2017}\right)}^{\textrm{difference in share of deaths for cause}\,i}}{\underbrace{_{n}r_{x}^{2014}-_{n}r_{x}^{2017}}_{\textrm{overall mortality rate difference}}}$$

where $_{n}\Delta_{x}$ is the total contribution for an age group,
$_{n}p_{x}^{i}$ is the proportion of deaths within age group $x$
due to cause $i$, and $_{n}r_{x}$ is the overall age-specific death
rate. The total difference in life expectancy is the net sum of the
age-cause components:

$$\sum_{i}{}_{n}\Delta_{x}^{i}={}_{n}\Delta_{x},\:\textrm{and}\:e_{0}^{2014}-e_{0}^{2017}=\sum_{x}{}_{n}\Delta_{x}=\sum_{x}\sum_{i}{}_{n}\Delta_{x}^{i}$$

## Summary
.right-column[
Life table decomposition useful for understanding links between proximal risks and mortality, and how they may 'explain' changing patterns of life expectancy.

Minimal assumptions, but not causal.

Example showing how the 'Deaths of Despair' narrative is hard to reconcile with diverse mortality patterns:
  - Declines have affected all race-ethnic groups.
  - Most of the decline due to opioid overdoses, homicide, and Alzheimer’s disease.
  - Deaths from suicide and alcohol-related causes have risen but explain little of America’s stagnating life expectancy trends.

## Formula for calculating the RCI
.footnote[Kakwani et al. 1997]
One way of writing the RCI is:
$$RCI= \frac{2}{n\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}R_{i}-1$$
where $\mu$ is the mean of $y_{i}$ (e.g., smoking status), $R_{i}$ is the fractional rank of the *i*th person in the socioeconomic (i.e., income) distribution.

The Absolute Concentration Index multiplies *RCI* by the mean smoking rate:
$$ACI=\mu*RCI$$

---
## Decomposition of the RCI
.footnote[Wagstaff et al. *J Econometrics* 2003]
If we can write the *RCI* as a function of a health variable $(y_{i})$ and a socioeconomic rank variable $(R_{i})$, i.e.
$$RCI= \frac{2}{n\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\color{red}{y_{i}}}R_{i}-1$$
--
Suppose that one can write a regression equation expressing the health outcome of interest $(y_{i})$ as a function of several $k_{i}$ determinants (e.g., age, gender, urban/rural status):
$$\color{red}{y_{i}}=\alpha + \sum{\beta_{x}x_{k_{i}}}+\epsilon_{i}$$

---
## Decomposition of the RCI
Since *RCI* is a function of $y_{i}$ and socioeconomic rank, one can then re-express the concentration index as:
$$RCI=\sum{(\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu)RCI_{k}}+gRCI_{e}/\mu$$
Where 
 - $\mu$ is the mean of *y*, 
 - $\bar{x}_{k}$ is the mean of $x_{k}$, 
 - $\beta_{k}$ is the regression coefficient for $x_{k}$, and 
 - RCIk is the concentration index for xk.

The basic idea: how much of the overall inequality is due to other factors that are both differentially distributed by income and affect smoking?

---
## Explained and unexplained components
This equation results in 2 components of socioeconomic inequality:
One part that is due to the association between income and other factors that predict health
The other part is ‘unexplained’, i.e., inequality that cannot be explained by systematic variation across income groups in the determinants of health.

---
## Two types of 'explained' components
.right-column[
### The influence of determinants depends on 2 things:

### $\color{blue}{RCI_{k}}$
#### the strength of the relationship between each factor and income (the concentration index for each determinant)

### $\color{blue}{\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu}$
#### the strength of the relationship between each factor and health, and its prevalence in the population (also referred to as the ‘elasticity’ of each factor with respect to health).
]

---
## Procedure for decomposing the Concentration Index
1 Estimate a regression equation predicting y (‘health’) from its determinants (βk):

$$\color{red}{y_{i}}=\alpha + \sum{\beta_{x}x_{k_{i}}}+\epsilon_{i}$$

2 Calculate the mean of y (μ) and of each of the determinants (e.g., education, age)

3 Calculate the Concentration Index for the health variable (C) each determinant in the equation predicting health (Ck).
That is, use each determinant as the “outcome” and estimate a CI for age, CI for education, etc.

---
## Procedure for decomposing the Concentration Index

4 Calculate the absolute contribution of each determinant by multiplying its ‘elasticity’ by its C:




5 Calculate the percentage contribution of each determinant:

Recall the decomposition formula:

$$RCI=\sum{(\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu)RCI_{k}}+gRCI_{e}/\mu$$
- Estimated $\beta$ coeff on education (logit scale): -.0389 (OR = 0.96)
- Marginal effect on probability scale: -.0051 (0.5 pct points)
- Mean education: 8.9 yrs
- Mean smoking rate: 17.5%

With these parameters, the elasticity of smoking with respect to education is: (-.0051 * 8.9 / .175) = -.2582

Interpretation: a 1% increase in education decreases smoking by 26% (not percentage points!). What about the RCI for education?

]

.right-column[
Recall the decomposition formula:

$$RCI=\sum{(\color{red}{\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu})\color{blue}{RCI_{k}}}+gRCI_{e}/\mu$$


So the .red[elasticity of smoking] (from the previous slide) with respect to education is (-.0051 * 8.9 / .175) = -.2582

Now we have the .blue[RCI for education] = 0.156

So now we can calculate the contribution of education as:

$$\text{Elasticity}\times RCI_{ed} = -.2582 * .156 = -.04$$

Thus education accounts for -.04/ -.0939 = 41.6%

## Caveats for decomposing the RCI
.right-column[
Decomposition results will be sensitive to the choice of determinants included (i.e., how well-specified the model is for predicting y).

The regression equations are predictive and not causal models.

Main utility is not in estimating the potential impact on y of changing the distribution of socioeconomic position, but in indicating the potential role that other factors may play in generating socioeconomic inequalities in health.

# Idea for Decomposition of Means
.right-column[
The core idea is to explain the distribution of the outcome variable in question by a set of factors that vary systematically with exposure status.

Thus, we want to know, on average, **why the mean level of health or disease differs between exposed and unexposed groups**.

Since, for most health outcomes there are multiple determinants, we may want to know which of these determinants plays more or less important roles in explaining the difference in average outcomes.

“Unpacking” or “decomposing” difference.

Evelyn Kitagawa was sociologist and demographer who devised a non-parametric method (1955) for decomposing differences between rates, refined by Prithwis das Gupta in 1978.
- Focused on understanding group contributions to rate differences.

Studies by Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973) applied regression-based decomposition methods to analyze the wage gap between men and women and between whites and blacks in the USA.
- Focused on how much of wage gap was 'explained' by differences in observable characteristics
]

---
## Brief note on interpretation
.right-column[
Decomposition methods are based on regression analyses, and thus all of the usual caveats about good specification apply

If regressions are purely descriptive, they reveal the associations that characterize the health inequality
Then inequality is explained in a statistical sense but implications for policies to reduce inequality are limited

If data allow identification of causal effects, then the factors that generate the inequality are identified
Then one can (potentially) draw conclusions about how policies would impact on inequality

What is the average difference in blood pressure between those with low vs. high education?

How much of this difference is due to the fact that determinants of blood pressure (e.g., BMI, smoking, demographics) differ between low and high educated groups?

Any residual difference is due to educational differences in the associations of risk factors for blood pressure.

## Differences in determinants
.left-column[
- Lower educated have higher BMI and are more likely to be smokers, as well as being older

## Differences in coefficients
.left-column[
- BMI and smoking both have larger coefficients for the better educated group.

- Age has a slightly stronger association for the less educated.

Various decomposition techniques exist that may be useful for analyzing social determinants of health
Life table decomposition—over time or between groups, or both
Regression-based decomposition of Concentration Index
Oaxaca decomposition of mean health between groups

All of these techniques make assumptions that need to be evaluated in the course of analysis

When used properly, decomposition techniques can help to provide key evidence on why health inequalities exist and change over time.
