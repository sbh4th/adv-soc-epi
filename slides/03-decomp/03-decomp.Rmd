  - Risk factors?
  - Demographic composition?
  - Social conditions?

- Unpacking the ‘components’ of health inequality is an opportunity to better integrate the monitoring of health inequalities with the etiology of health inequalities.

## Summary
.right-column[
Life table decomposition useful for understanding links between proximal risks and mortality, and how they may 'explain' changing patterns of life expectancy.

Minimal assumptions, but not causal.

Example showing how the 'Deaths of Despair' narrative is hard to reconcile with diverse mortality patterns:
  - Declines have affected all race-ethnic groups.
  - Most of the decline due to opioid overdoses, homicide, and Alzheimer’s disease.
  - Deaths from suicide and alcohol-related causes have risen but explain little of America’s stagnating life expectancy trends.

## Formula for writing the Concentration Index
.footnote[Kakwani et al. (1997)]
.pull-left[
Recall that we can write the CI as:

$$RCI= \frac{2}{n\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}R_{i}-1$$
where $\mu$ is the mean of $y_{i}$ (e.g., smoking status), $R_{i}$ is the fractional rank of the *i*th person in the socioeconomic (i.e., income) distribution.
]


.pull-right[
The basic idea here is to develop a model for predicting $y$ using several determinants, then plug that model back into the equation for the $RCI$
]

---
## Decomposition of the RCI
.footnote[Wagstaff et al. *J Econometrics* 2003]

.right-column[
Since the $RCI$ is a function of health $(y_{i})$ and a socioeconomic rank variable $(R_{i})$, i.e.
$$RCI= \frac{2}{n\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\color{red}{y_{i}}}R_{i}-1$$

Then suppose that one can write a regression equation expressing the health outcome of interest $(y_{i})$ as a function of several $k_{i}$ determinants (e.g., age, gender, urban/rural status):
$$\color{red}{y_{i}}=\alpha + \sum{\beta_{x}x_{k_{i}}}+\epsilon_{i}$$
]

---
## Decomposition of the RCI
Since *RCI* is a function of $y_{i}$ and socioeconomic rank, one can then re-express the concentration index as:
$$RCI=\sum{(\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu)RCI_{k}}+gRCI_{e}/\mu$$
Where 
 - $\mu$ is the mean of *y*, 
 - $\bar{x}_{k}$ is the mean of $x_{k}$, 
 - $\beta_{k}$ is the regression coefficient for $x_{k}$, and 
 - $RCI_{k}$ is the concentration index for $x_{k}$.

The basic idea: how much of the overall inequality is due to other factors that are both differentially distributed by $x$ (income) and also affect $y$ (e.g., smoking)?

---
## Explained and unexplained components
This equation results in 2 components of socioeconomic inequality:
$$RCI=\sum{(\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu)RCI_{k}}+gRCI_{e}/\mu$$
.pull-left[
One part $(\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu)RCI_{k}$ that is due to the association between income and other factors that predict health
]

.pull-right[
The other part $(gRCI_{e}/\mu)$ is ‘unexplained’, i.e., inequality that cannot be explained by systematic variation across income groups in the determinants of health.
]

---
## Two types of 'explained' components

```

<br>

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"} 
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "rci-arrows-color.png"))
```
]
.pull-right[
The influence of determinants depends on two things:

### $\color{blue}{RCI_{k}}$
#### the strength of the relationship between each factor and income $(C_{k})$

### $\color{red}{\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu}$
#### the strength of the relationship between each factor and health, and its prevalence in the population (elasticity).
]

---
## Procedure for decomposing the Concentration Index

.right-column[
1 Estimate a regression equation predicting $y$ (‘health’) from its determinants $(\beta_{k}x_{k})$:

$$\color{red}{y_{i}}=\alpha + \sum{\beta_{x}x_{k_{i}}}+\epsilon_{i}$$

2 Calculate the mean of $y$ $(\mu)$ and of each of the determinants (e.g., education, age)

3 Calculate the Concentration Index for the health variable (C) *and* for each determinant in the equation predicting health $(C_{k})$.

- That is, use each determinant $x_{k}$ as the "outcome" and estimate a CI for age, CI for education, etc.
]

---
## Procedure for decomposing the Concentration Index

.right-column[
4 Calculate the absolute contribution of each determinant by multiplying its ‘elasticity’ by its concentration index $(C_{k})$:

$$(\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu)RCI_{k}$$


5 Calculate the percentage contribution of each determinant:

$$[(\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu)RCI_{k}]/RCI$$

### Estimation for a specific factor: **Education**
]
.right-column[
Recall the decomposition formula:

$$RCI=\sum{(\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu)RCI_{k}}+gRCI_{e}/\mu$$
- Estimated $\beta$ coeff on education (logit scale): -.0389 (OR = 0.96)
- Marginal effect on probability scale: -.0051 (0.5 pct points)
- Mean education: 8.9 yrs
- Mean smoking rate: 17.5%

With these parameters, the elasticity of smoking with respect to education is: (-.0051 * 8.9 / .175) = -.2582

Interpretation: a 1% increase in education decreases smoking by 26% (not percentage points!). 

What about the RCI for education?

### Estimation for a specific factor: Education
]

.right-column[
Recall the decomposition formula:

$$RCI=\sum{(\color{red}{\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu})\color{blue}{RCI_{k}}}+gRCI_{e}/\mu$$


So the .red[elasticity of smoking] (from the previous slide) with respect to education is (-.0051 * 8.9 / .175) = -.2582

Now we have the .blue[RCI for education] = 0.156

So now we can calculate the contribution of education as:

$$\text{Elasticity}\times RCI_{ed} = -.2582 * .156 = -.04$$

Thus education accounts for -.04/ -.0939 = 41.6% of the overall $RCI$

---
## Caveats for decomposing the RCI
.right-column[
Decomposition results will be sensitive to the choice of determinants included (i.e., how well-specified the model is for predicting y).

The regression equations are predictive and not causal models.

Main utility is not in estimating the potential impact on y of changing the distribution of socioeconomic position, but in indicating the potential role that other factors may play in generating socioeconomic inequalities in health.

# Idea for Decomposition of Means
.right-column[
The core idea is to explain the distribution of the outcome variable in question by a set of factors that vary systematically with exposure status.

Thus, we want to know, on average, **why the mean level of health or disease differs between exposed and unexposed groups**.

Since, for most health outcomes there are multiple determinants, we may want to know which of these determinants plays more or less important roles in explaining the difference in average outcomes.

“Unpacking” or “decomposing” difference.

.right-column[
Evelyn Kitagawa was sociologist and demographer who devised a non-parametric method (1955) for decomposing differences between rates, refined by Prithwis das Gupta in 1978.
- Focused on understanding group contributions to rate differences.

Studies by Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973) applied regression-based decomposition methods to analyze the wage gap between men and women and between whites and blacks in the USA.
- Focused on how much of wage gap was 'explained' by differences in observable characteristics
]

---
## Brief note on interpretation
.right-column[
Decomposition methods are based on regression analyses, and thus all of the usual caveats about good specification apply

If regressions are purely descriptive, they reveal the associations that characterize the health inequality
Then inequality is explained in a statistical sense but implications for policies to reduce inequality are limited

If data allow identification of causal effects, then the factors that generate the inequality are identified

Then one can (potentially) draw conclusions about how policies would impact on inequality

Various decomposition techniques exist that may be useful for analyzing social determinants of health
Life table decomposition—over time or between groups, or both
Regression-based decomposition of Concentration Index
Oaxaca decomposition of mean health between groups

All of these techniques make assumptions that need to be evaluated in the course of analysis

When used properly, decomposition techniques can help to provide key evidence on why health inequalities exist and change over time.
