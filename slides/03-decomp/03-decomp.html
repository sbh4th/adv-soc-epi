# Moving from Description to Explanation
.right-column[
- Ultimately, we want to know why health inequalities are changing over time—what changed?
  - Risk factors?
  - Demographic composition?
  - Social conditions?

- Unpacking the ‘components’ of health inequality is an opportunity to better integrate the monitoring of health inequalities with the etiology of health inequalities.

- These techniques often involve various kinds of ‘counterfactual’ scenarios

# The 'usual' approach
Conventional methods for “explaining” effects of social exposures
Estimate crude or demographic-adjusted effect (logit, hazard)
Add “conventional” risk factors (physiological, behavioural)
Add “novel” risk factors (flavour-of-the-week)
Interpret accordingly

Limitations of conventional approach
Often fail to consider entire socioeconomic distribution (typically low vs. high only) in the context of “explanation”
Often ignore absolute risk
Typically do not provide estimates of the specific contributions of other factors to the “explained” proportion

## Formula for calculating the RCI
.footnote[Kakwani et al. 1997]
One way of writing the RCI is:
`$$RCI= \frac{2}{n\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}R_{i}-1$$`
where `\(\mu\)` is the mean of `\(y_{i}\)` (e.g., smoking status), `\(R_{i}\)` is the fractional rank of the *i*th person in the socioeconomic (i.e., income) distribution.

The Absolute Concentration Index multiplies *RCI* by the mean smoking rate:
`$$ACI=\mu*RCI$$`
---
## Decomposition of the RCI
.footnote[Wagstaff et al. *J Econometrics* 2003]
If we can write the *RCI* as a function of a health variable `\((y_{i})\)` and a socioeconomic rank variable `\((R_{i})\)`, i.e.
`$$RCI= \frac{2}{n\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\color{red}{y_{i}}}R_{i}-1$$`
--
Suppose that one can write a regression equation expressing the health outcome of interest `\((y_{i})\)` as a function of several `\(k_{i}\)` determinants (e.g., age, gender, urban/rural status):
`$$\color{red}{y_{i}}=\alpha + \sum{\beta_{x}x_{k_{i}}}+\epsilon_{i}$$`

---
## Decomposition of the RCI
Since *RCI* is a function of `\(y_{i}\)` and socioeconomic rank, one can then re-express the concentration index as:
`$$RCI=\sum{(\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu)RCI_{k}}+gRCI_{e}/\mu$$`
Where 
 - `\(\mu\)` is the mean of *y*, 
 - `\(\bar{x}_{k}\)` is the mean of `\(x_{k}\)`, 
 - `\(\beta_{k}\)` is the regression coefficient for `\(x_{k}\)`, and 
 - RCIk is the concentration index for xk.

The basic idea: how much of the overall inequality is due to other factors that are both differentially distributed by income and affect smoking?

---
## Explained and unexplained components
This equation results in 2 components of socioeconomic inequality:
One part that is due to the association between income and other factors that predict health
The other part is ‘unexplained’, i.e., inequality that cannot be explained by systematic variation across income groups in the determinants of health.

---
## Two types of 'explained' components
.right-column[
### The influence of determinants depends on 2 things:

### `\(\color{blue}{RCI_{k}}\)`
#### the strength of the relationship between each factor and income (the concentration index for each determinant)

### `\(\color{blue}{\beta_{k}\bar{x}_{k}/\mu}\)`
#### the strength of the relationship between each factor and health, and its prevalence in the population (also referred to as the ‘elasticity’ of each factor with respect to health).
]

---
## Procedure for decomposing the Concentration Index
1 Estimate a regression equation predicting y (‘health’) from its determinants (βk):

`$$\color{red}{y_{i}}=\alpha + \sum{\beta_{x}x_{k_{i}}}+\epsilon_{i}$$`

2 Calculate the mean of y (μ) and of each of the determinants (e.g., education, age)

3 Calculate the Concentration Index for the health variable (C) each determinant in the equation predicting health (Ck).
That is, use each determinant as the “outcome” and estimate a CI for age, CI for education, etc.

## Procedure for decomposing the Concentration Index

4 Calculate the absolute contribution of each determinant by multiplying its ‘elasticity’ by its C:




5 Calculate the percentage contribution of each determinant:

# Idea
The core idea is to explain the distribution of the outcome variable in question by a set of factors that vary systematically with exposure status.

Thus, we want to know, on average, why the mean level of health or disease differs between exposed and unexposed groups.

Since, for most health outcomes there are multiple determinants, we may want to know which of these determinants plays more or less important roles in explaining the difference in average outcomes.

“Unpacking” or “decomposing” difference.

---
# Origins


---
## Brief note on interpretation
Decomposition methods are based on regression analyses, and thus all of the usual caveats about good specification apply

If regressions are purely descriptive, they reveal the associations that characterize the health inequality
Then inequality is explained in a statistical sense but implications for policies to reduce inequality are limited

If data allow identification of causal effects, then the factors that generate the inequality are identified
Then one can (potentially) draw conclusions about how policies would impact on inequality

### Two potential sources of mean differences in outcomes

### 1. Means
#### Differences in the prevalence of determinants of outcome

### 2. Effects
#### Differences in the effect of a given determinant on the outcome (i.e., effect measure modification)

## The two methods are equally valid
.right-column[
In the first,the differences in the x’s are weighted by the coefficients of the unexposed group and the differences in the coefficients are weighted by the x’s of the exposed group: 
`$$y^{exp} - y^{unexp} = \Delta\bar{x}\beta^{unexp}-\Delta\beta x^{exp}$$`

whereas, in the second, the differences in the x’s are weighted by the coefficients of the exposed group and the differences in the coefficients are weighted by the x’s of the unexposed group: 
`$$y^{exp} - y^{unexp} = \Delta\bar{x}\beta^{exp}-\Delta\beta x^{unexp}$$`

.right-column[
What is the average difference in blood pressure between those with low vs. high education?

How much of this difference is due to the fact that determinants of blood pressure (e.g., BMI, smoking, demographics) differ between low and high educated groups?

Any residual difference is due to educational differences in the associations of risk factors for blood pressure.

Various decomposition techniques exist that may be useful for analyzing social determinants of health
Life table decomposition—over time or between groups, or both
Regression-based decomposition of Concentration Index
Oaxaca decomposition of mean health between groups

All of these techniques make assumptions that need to be evaluated in the course of analysis

When used properly, decomposition techniques can help to provide key evidence on why health inequalities exist and change over time.
