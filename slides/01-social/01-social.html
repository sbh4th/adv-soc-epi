## Why should we care?
.pull-left[
### Because we are epidemiologists, and exposure measurement matters!

### Ethical importance of social inequalities in health.

.pull-right[
As with other exposures, we need to think about:
- specific links between the elements of exposure and outcome of interest
- intensity
- duration
- cumulative vs. transient effects
- thresholds or dose-response
- direct or indirect effects of exposure
]

---
## The need for accuracy
**(1)** Interest in social position as an EXPOSURE:
- Modifiable exposures and counterfactual causation
Individual causal effect of social position (X), for disease/outcome Y=1:

`$$Pr[Y = 1 | Set(X = x1)] \hspace{1em} vs. \hspace{1em} Pr[Y = 1 | Set(X = x2)]$$`

- Difference (or ratio) of between average risks of Y if assigned to differing levels of X (e.g., x1 vs. x2)

--

**(2)** Need to control for CONFOUNDING by social position:
- Social position correlated with many disease risks and exposures
- Poor measurement of confounders=misclassification
- Potential to bias your effect measure of interest

---
## Position vs. Status
.footnote[Source: https://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/annual_earnings_of_teachers_and_non-teachers]
.pull-left[
- We usually think of socioeconomic indicators as “fixed” characteristics of individuals (i.e., status), at least analytically, but…

- Theoretically more useful to consider them as markers of location (i.e., position) in the social structure that may vary over time and with local context.

- “Position” implies that a given status takes place in the context of an overarching structure.

## Key ideas: SEP measures are context dependent

.right-column[
&gt;“There is no single best indicator of SEP suitable for all study aims and applicable at all time points in all settings. Each indicator measures different, often related aspects of socioeconomic stratification and may be more or less relevant to different health outcomes and at different stages in the life course. 

&gt;The choice of SEP measure(s) should ideally be informed by consideration of the specific research question and the proposed mechanisms linking SEP to the outcome.”

## Individual-level measures: Occupation
.pull-left[
### Measurement
- Relevant exposure period? (current vs. longest held job)
- Relations to workplace and means of production

### Interpretation
- May reflect both material resources and a measure of prestige/social standing
- Influences living conditions and represents a link between education and income. 
]

### Challenges
- Individual vs. household exposure status
- Comparability over time with changing societal norms
- Often country-specific, so limited comparability.
- Need to make specific links to exposures encountered in occupational setting
]

## Example: Smoking and class in Denmark
### How to locate Danish 15-year olds in social class?
Holstein et al. (2019) used parents occupational social class.
“…defined by the occupational skills and competencies necessary for the job as well as the power and control associated with the position”

&gt;“The participants reported their father’s and mother’s occupation and the research group coded this information into OSC from I (highest) to V (lowest) [14]. We added OSC VI to include economically inactive parents who receive unemployment benefits, disability pension, or other kinds of transfer income.”

Each schoolchild was categorised by the .red[highest ranking parent] into high (I–II), middle (III–IV) and low (V–VI) OSC.”

&gt;“In terms of mortality risk, those excluded from high school in the early part of the 20th century .red[are not comparable] with those excluded from high school a generation later, because those left behind by the high school expansions in mid century likely had childhoods that were more disadvantaged along many dimensions, and so were at higher mortality risk all along. Describing differences between these two subgroups as a ‘decline’ in the life expectancy of high school non-completers simply because they were born at different times almost certainly reflects [lagged selection bias].”

.left-column[

]
.right-column[
Do you think that income per se is causally related to health?

If not, why do we measure it?

How would you test it?

Potential pathways involving income:
- Material conditions (Housing quality, food, clothing, medical care, opportunities for recreation, etc.)
- Psychosocial factors (financial insecurity, etc.)
- Health behaviors
- These factors often travel together (residual confounding).
]
---
## Individual measures: household income
.pull-left[
### Measurement
- Continuous is ideal, but often much missing data

- Categories may be some improvement, but how to adjust for inflation?
- Some novel study designs to get more data (links to tax records, reporting above or below thresholds)
]

.pull-right[
### Interpretation
Difficult, since it is unlikely that income itself is the causal exposure

### Challenges
Consumption may be better linked to resources that affect health, but very expensive (both time and $) to measure (e.g. World Bank’s LSMS)
]

## Questions about income

Household or individual income?

Absolute amount or categorical?

- May be associated with living conditions such as safe housing, freedom from violence, and access to health enhancing resources.

- In some countries, ethnic background shows strong associations with important behavioural and biological risk factors, but there is wide variation.
- Certain ethnic groups may be victims of overt and covert discrimination that can affect their health through multiple channels.

## Is 'Objective' Social Position the Gold Standard?
.right-column[
Increased emphasis in recent years on measuring and estimating the effects of subjective social status (SSS)

Idea is that perceived social status may be associated with stress responses, negative emotions, psycho-neuroendocrine pathways that may lead to poorer health 

Across several large samples, SSS was found to be correlated both both income (r = 0.39–0.58) and education (r = 0.30–0.40) (Dunn et al., 2005; Operario et al., 2004; Singh-Manoux et al., 2003)

.pull-left[
### Measuring subjective position
- MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (ladder measurement scale)

- May be applied to specific dimensions of SEP (education, income) or defined by users as the ladder at right

- Thought to capture residual variation in social position and perceptions of status

- “Insofar as social standing has beneficial effects on biological processes related to health, standing on the community ladder may be as important as standing on the SES ladder.” (Adler, Stewart, 2007)

## What about SEP in poorer countries?
Potential difficulties:
- Large peasant classes
- Informal economic sector
- Remittances from family members working abroad
- Geographic differences

Ideally, measure consumption expenditures (the purchase of goods and services), but questionnaires are lengthy (World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Survey takes about 1 hr to complete)

Current approaches attempt to measure household assets 
- What people own
- Not a proxy for current consumption
- Idea is to try and capture a household’s long run economic status

## Area-based measures of SEP

.pull-right[
### Interpretation
- Especially challenging for a composite index of SEP (how to define the causal effect?)
- “Independent” effects are of enormous interest

### Challenges
- Often used as imperfect proxies for “missing” individual-level data
- How to deal with selection into and out of areas by individuals of different SEP
]

---
## Area-based measures in Canada
Pampalon Index
  - Census dissemination areas (DAs), approx. 400-700 persons. Why?

Components
- the proportion of those 15 years and older with no high school diploma;
- the employment/population ratio of people aged 15 years and older;
- the average income of people aged 15 years and older;
- the proportion of individuals aged 15 years and older living alone;
- the proportion of individuals aged 15 years and older who are separated, divorced or widowed;
- and the proportion of single-parent families.

Some data manipulation (smoothing, age-sex standardization)

Principal components analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation

## Recommendations
.footnote[Galobardes 2004]
.right-column[
1. Have a hypothesis about SEP and disease mechanisms.

1. Tailor your indicator to capture presumed etiologic effects.

1. Use several indicators.
1. Consider your specific population, birth-cohort, time period.

1. Consider area-based as well as individual-based measures.

1. Think about specificity in interpreting your findings.

1. Comparability between subgroups (e.g., gender, ethnicity).
