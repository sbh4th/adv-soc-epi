- Questions about the impact of an intervention (the change that can be causally attributed to the program) are about what-ifs

- Prospectively, we can think about how the world would be different *if we intervened* to change the status quo

- Retrospectively, we can think about what *would have been* had we not implemented a particular policy or program

- These alternative causal states are known as counterfactuals

- We are surrounded by what-ifs with potential relevance to population health—just look at the recent headlines!

- What-if or counterfactual questions are about hypotheticals—*so how can we answer them*?

- The potential outcomes framework provides us with a guide for posing and answering counterfactual questions; it is the common language for impact evaluation in the social sciences

- The potential outcomes framework uses the specification of well-defined causal states to which all members of the population of interest could be exposed to identify what would have been under an alternative counterfactual scenario

## Potential Outcomes

- The potential outcomes for each individual are defined as the true values of the outcome that would result from exposure to well-defined, alternative causal states

- *Each individual has a potential outcome under both the treatment and control states*  

- With a binary treatment, the potential outcomes are given by the random variables $Y^{1}$ and $Y^{0}$; we assume that each individual in the population has a potential outcome under both states

## The selection problem

.right-column[
The naïve estimator rarely yields an unbiased treatment effect

Why? Because treatment and control groups are rarely exchangeable (i.e., programs/policies are selectively placed in different areas and the decision to participate is often voluntary)

These differences could affect potential outcomes, creating bias

Economist call this selection or omitted variable bias

In epidemiology, the effect of these pre-existing differences between groups is commonly called confounding bias

Without a credible substitute for the unobserved potential outcomes, causal impact cannot be established.

The key is to generate groups of individuals that are statistically indistinguishable from one another in the absence of an intervention—we must somehow mimic the counterfactual

We can use experimental or quasi-experimental techniques to attempt to recover the causal effect
]


---
## What are randomized experiments

> the word experiment is used in a quite precise sense to mean an investigation where the system under study is under the control of the investigator. This means that the individuals or material investigated, the nature of the treatments or manipulations under study and the measurement procedures used are all selected, in their important features at least, by the investigator. (Cox, 2000)

Randomized experiments are experiments “in which units are assigned to receive the treatment or an alternative condition by a random process such as the toss of a coin.” (Shadish, 2002)


---
## RCTs and exchangeability

.right-column[
If treatment is assigned randomly, it is said to be exogenous 

Comparison groups are the same with respect to measured and unmeasured characteristics (no unmeasured confounding or omitted variable bias) and each unit’s potential outcomes are independent of actual treatment assignment, $(Y_{i}^{1}, Y_{i}^{0} | D)$

Under these conditions, the treatment and control groups are exchangeable, which implies that the probability of the outcome in the control group is the same as the probability of the outcome in the treated group had they been untreated (and vice versa)

Randomization is so highly valued because, under ideal conditions, it provides an unbiased estimate of the causal impact of the intervention in the population under study

## 'Quasi'-experiments

.right-column[
Oftentimes we do not have control over treatment assignment and must investigate how individuals end up in alternative states

The term quasi-experiment refers to:
>“experiments that have treatments, outcome measures, and experimental units, but do not use random assignment to create the comparisons from which treatment-caused change is inferred.”(Cook, 1979)

Assignment is by self-selection, by which units choose treatment for themselves, or by means of administrator selection

Consequently, unlike RCTs, comparison groups may differ in many systematic ways other than the presence of the treatment

So far we have discussed the average treatment effect or ATE

The ATE might, however, not be the only quantity of interest

The causal parameters we can estimate will depend on our research question, and the design of our evaluation study

## Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)

It might make sense to evaluate the impact for those who self-select into certain exposures/programs, in which case a conditional average treatment effect may be more relevant; the ATT is the most widely-used measure of average impact 

The ATT is the average treatment effect for those who typically take the treatment: 

$$E(\delta_{i}|d_{i}=1) = E(y_{i}^{1}|d_{i} = 1) - E(y_{i}^{0}|d_{i} = 1)$$ 

Unbiased estimation requires: 

$$E(y_{i}^{0}|d_{i} = 1) = E(y_{i}^{0}|d_{i} = 0)$$

Thus, it relies on identification of one counterfactual, $E(y_{i}^{0}|d_{i} = 1)$

## More on the ATE vs. the ATT

.left-column[

Example from a basic income program for the unemployed
]

.right-column[

- The ATE is the expected what-if difference in the outcome if we could take *randomly selected* unemployed workers and compare their outcomes in both the program vs. not

- The ATT is the expected what-if difference in the outcome if we could observe workers *enrolled* in the basic income program under two scenarios, a factual one in which they were enrolled and the other in which they were not

- Thus, the ATT answers the question about whether the social program was beneficial specifically among those who were enrolled, whereas the ATE examines whether it was beneficial across all of the unemployed workers who could potentially enroll, including those who did and those who didn’t
]

---
## Average Treatment Effect on the Controls (ATC)

A less common contrast is given by the average treatment effect on the controls (ATC): $$E(\delta_{i}|d_{i}=0) = E(y_{i}^{1}|d_{i} = 0) - E(y_{i}^{0}|d_{i} = 0)$$ 

The ATC answers the questions about whether the program is beneficial for those who are not enrolled (e.g., would a program that attempts to enroll nonparticipants be beneficial?

Unbiased estimation requires: 
$$E(y_{i}^{1}|d_{i} = 0) = E(y_{i}^{1}|d_{i} = 1)$$ 

Thus, it relies on identification of one counterfactual, $E(y_{i}^{1} | d_{i}=0)$

## Relation between ATE, ATT, and ATC

.right-column[

- The ATE is the average of the ATT and ATC, weighted by the proportions who were treated ($\pi$) or control ($1-\pi$), respectively:
$$ATE = \pi * E(\delta|D=1) + (1-\pi) * E(\delta|D=0)$$


- In a RCT, the treatment effects should be the same among those randomized to treatment vs. control (ATE=ATT=ATC).

- Why?

Using the table and assuming $\pi = 0.3$, calculate the: 


| Group | $E[Y^{1} \lvert.]$ |  $E[Y^{0} \lvert.]$  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Treatment group $(D=1)$ | 10 | .blue[6] |
| Control group $(D=0)$  | .blue[8] | 5 |


- naïve estimate of the ATE,
- the ATE 
- the ATT 
- the ATC

## Exchangeability

.pull-left[
For the observed contrasts to represent causal effects, we need the proxies to represent the unobserved counterfactual outcomes

If the average outcome in the control group equals the average outcome in the treated group had it been untreated (and vice versa) , the groups are exchangeable, i.e., for all $d$, 
$E(Y_{i}^{d}) = E(Y_{i}|D=d)$

## Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)

.left-column[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "spillovers.png"))
```
]

.right-column[
The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) assumes that an individual’s potential outcome is unaffected by the treatment status of other individuals 

This assumption is most commonly violated when there is interference (an individual’s outcome depends on the treatment values of other individuals), or in the case of ecological treatments, if there are spillover effects

Say we wanted to evaluate the impact of vaccine camps assigned to randomly selected villages on the incidence of the disease—what are some potential violations of SUTVA?

---
## Consistency

.left-column[]

.right-column[
Causal inference requires that a treatment is defined unambiguously, which a general concern in social epidemiology

This vagueness of some potential treatments has led some to suggest that only the causal effects of treatments that can be hypothetically manipulated should be considered (i.e., Holland’s “no causation without manipulation”)

However, consistency violations are less of a concern in impact evaluation (and guaranteed by experiments) since we are dealing with treatments that are, by definition, manipulable

## Positivity

.left-column[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "positivity.png"))
```
]

.right-column[
 The positivity assumption states that there is a nonzero (ie, positive) probability of receiving every level of exposure for every combination of values of exposure and confounders that occur among individuals in the population

Generally less of a concern for RCTs, non-positivity, sometimes called structural confounding, is a concern for observational designs that often rely on regression adjustment for confounders to achieve conditional exchangeability
