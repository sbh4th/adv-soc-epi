## Formula for writing the Concentration Index
.footnote[Kakwani et al. (1997)]
.pull-left[
One way of writing the CI is:
$$RCI= \frac{2}{n\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}R_{i}-1$$
where $\mu$ is the mean of $y_{i}$ (e.g., smoking status), $R_{i}$ is the fractional rank of the *i*th person in the socioeconomic (i.e., income) distribution.
]

--

.pull-right[
The Absolute Concentration Index multiplies *RCI* by the mean smoking rate:
$$ACI=\mu*RCI$$

### Example of Relative and Absolute CI

### Relationship between rank-based measures

.pull-left[
### Calculating SII
Regress health outcome (e.g., smoking) on midpoint of socioeconomic categories, weighted by proportion in the population:

$$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Rank + \epsilon$$ 

Slope Index of Inequality = $\beta_{1}$

Measures the average expected change in $y$ when moving from the bottom (0) to the top (1) of the SEP rank distribution.
]

--

.pull-right[
### Relation to the RCI
There is a specific parallel with the RCI. 

If we transform the outcome variable from $y$ to $2\sigma^{2}_{Rank}*(y/\mu)$ and run the following regression:

$$2\sigma^{2}_{Rank}*(y/\mu) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Rank + \epsilon$$
Then $\beta_{1}$ = Relative Concentration Index.
]

---
### Example (Stata) for calculating SII and RII
.center[
```{r, echo=F, out.height="80%", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "stata-data.png"))
```
]

--

```{stata, eval=F}
/* regress smoking rate on rank */
reg rate rank [fw=pop], cformat(%4.3f)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        rate |      Coef.   Std. Err.      t    P>|t|     [95% Conf. Interval]
-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
        rank |     -0.166      0.003   -48.73   0.000       -0.173      -0.160
       _cons |      0.274      0.002   140.41   0.000        0.270       0.278
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The coefficient on the “rank” variable is the estimated change in the rate of illness (e.g., smoking) as one moves from the bottom to the top of the class distribution (decreases by 17 percentage points).

## Relative Index of Inequality (RII)
.footnote[Pamuk (1985), Kunst and Mackenbach (1995)]
.pull-left[
### 'Original' RII
$RII = \beta_{1} / \bar{y}$

$RII$ = -16.6 / 19.1 = -87%

This indicates that as one moves from the bottom (0) to the top (1) of SEP distribution the outcome (smoking) decreases by 87%
]

--

.pull-right[
### Kunst-Mackenbach modification
$RII_{KM} = \beta_{0} / (\beta_{0} + \beta_{1})$

$RII_{KM}$ = 27.4 / 10.8 = 2.5

Interpreted as the ratio of health for the bottom vs. the top of the socioeconomic distribution (analogous to more traditional RR used in epidemiologic studies).

## Two mechanisms for changing inequality
.footnote[Renard (2019)]
Size of social groups will also change SII/RII without mortality change. Increasing the size of higher educated groups (e.g., larger share with higher education) increases inequality:
