## Why monitor health inequalities?
.pull-left[
### Surveillance

- Natural complement to monitoring overall health

- Essential for detecting important changes in risk
]

.pull-right[
### Impact

- Opportunity to evaluate etiological explanations for health inequalities

- Evaluating the distributional impacts of public health interventions and medical innovations

- Crucial for measuring the responsiveness of health care systems to those most in need
]

>"inequalities in composite coverage [of interventions] have been greatly reduced over the past 5 years, since coverage has increased the most in the poorest states and for the poorest deciles of the population."

# Inequality is an ambiguous concept
Different measures of inequality emphasize different concepts.
.right-column[
>“If a concept has some basic ambiguity, then a precise representation of that ambiguous concept must preserve that ambiguity…This issue is quite central to the need for descriptive accuracy in inequality measurement, which has to be distinguished from fully ranked, unambiguous assertions.”

## What should we measure?
.pull-left[
### Total Health Inequality
- complement to measurement of average health
- measured across all individuals
- avoids normative choice of social groups
- facilitates unambiguous comparisons over time/place
]

.pull-right[
### Social Group Differences in Health
- measured across normatively important social groups
- particular social groups chosen a priori
- provide insights into causal processes linking health and social position

- Life-span variation reflects uncertainty in the risk (timing) of death.
- People are generally willing to pay to reduce uncertainty.

- Heterogeneity is crucial for accurate forecasts in insurance and annuity markets, and should be measured.
- Monitoring life-span variation may facilitate early detection of adverse  mortality developments and warrant social interventions at younger ages.

## Consequences for interpretation
.footnote[Arsenault, Harper et al. (2017)]
.pull-left[
- Compared country ranks for magnitude of wealth-related inequalities in vaccination using extreme groups vs. whole-pop measures.

- Mostly similar, however, some serious inconsistencies:
  - Armenia had highest inequality using poor vs. non-poor, but 34th using whole pop measure.
  
  - Moldova ranks 10th using pairwise measure but 38th using whole pop measure.
