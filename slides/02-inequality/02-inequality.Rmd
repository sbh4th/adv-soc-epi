## Formula for writing the Concentration Index
.footnote[Kakwani et al. (1997)]
.pull-left[
One way of writing the CI is:
$$RCI= \frac{2}{n\mu} \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}R_{i}-1$$
where $\mu$ is the mean of $y_{i}$ (e.g., smoking status), $R_{i}$ is the fractional rank of the *i*th person in the socioeconomic (i.e., income) distribution.
]

.pull-right[
The Absolute Concentration Index multiplies *RCI* by the mean smoking rate:
$$ACI=\mu*RCI$$

## Two mechanisms for changing inequality
.footnote[Renard (2019)]
Size of social groups will also change SII/RII without mortality change. Increasing the size of higher educated groups (e.g., larger share with higher education) increases inequality:

### Index of Disparity
.footnote[Pearcy and Keppel (1999)]

.pull-left[
Measures the mean deviation of the group rates from some reference point as a proportion of that reference point

$$ID = \sum_{j=1}^{J}(|y_{j} - y_{ref}|/n)/y_{ref}$$
Where $y_{j}$ is the rate in group $j$, $y_{ref}$ is the rate for the reference point, and $J$ is the number of groups, or the number of groups minus 1 if one of the groups is the reference point.
]

.pull-right[
Note that ID has a few important but potentially modifiable characteristics:
- Measures relative inequality
- Does not account for population size of groups
- Uses best observed health as reference level

Interpretation is also a little awkward: the average deviation across social groups as a proportion of the reference level

Are there alternatives?

Measures of health inequality are not value neutral.
- Scale of measurement (absolute/relative)
- Weighting: how much and to whom?
- Reference points: different from what standard?

The choices above have an important impact on our judgments of both the magnitude of health inequality and whether health inequalities are worsening or improving.

Monitoring health inequalities requires both precise measurement and value judgments—they are inseparable.

A suite of health inequality measures is likely necessary to provide a complete description of the magnitude of inequality.
